    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Okay, so you made some delicious tempuraâ€¦. now, how should you eat it? Sure, you could have it over soup noodles or rolled up in a maki, but if you want to make the tempura the star of your meal (and not the noodles!), dipping your crispy deep fried creations in a simple sauce is definitely the best way to bring out the flavour of all your hard work!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup dashi stock (or, kombu dashi for vegetarians)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Japanese soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 inch piece of daikon (or more), peeled</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place dashi, soy sauce, mirin and sugar in a small saucepan. On low heat, bring to simmer and cook until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and set aside until cool.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, finely grate daikon using the small holes on a grater or a microplane. Squeeze the water from the grated daikon</li>
        <li>Serve at room temperature or slightly warmed as a dipping sauce for tempura. Place sauce in small bowls and add grated daikon to taste.</li>
    </ol>
